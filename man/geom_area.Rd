\title{Area plot.}
\usage{
geom_area(mapping = NULL, data = NULL, stat = "identity",
  position = "stack", na.rm = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{mapping}{The aesthetic mapping, usually constructed with
\code{\link{aes}} or \code{\link{aes_string}}. Only needs to be set
at the layer level if you are overriding the plot defaults.}

\item{data}{A data frame. If specified, overrides the default data frame
defined at the top level of the plot.}

\item{stat}{The statistical transformation to use on the data for this
layer, as a string.}

\item{position}{Postion adjustment, either as a string, or the result of
a call to a position adjustment function.}

\item{na.rm}{If \code{FALSE} (the default), removes missing values with
a warning.  If \code{TRUE} silently removes missing values.}

\item{...}{other arguments passed on to \code{\link{layer}}. There are
  three types of arguments you can use here:

  \itemize{
  \item Aesthetics: to set an aesthetic to a fixed value, like
     \code{color = "red"} or \code{size = 3}.
  \item Other arguments to the layer, for example you override the
    default \code{stat} associated with the layer.
  \item Other arguments passed on to the stat.

\description{
An area plot is the continuous analog of a stacked bar chart (see
\code{\link{geom_bar}}), and can be used to show how composition of the
whole varies over the range of x.  Choosing the order in which different
components is stacked is very important, as it becomes increasing hard to
see the individual pattern as you move up the stack.
}
\details{
An area plot is a special case of \code{\link{geom_ribbon}}, where the
minimum of the range is fixed to 0, and the position adjustment defaults
to position_stacked.
