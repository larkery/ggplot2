\title{Count the number of observations at each location.}
\usage{
geom_count(mapping = NULL, data = NULL, stat = "sum",
  position = "identity", na.rm = FALSE, show_guide = NA, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{mapping}{The aesthetic mapping, usually constructed with
\code{\link{aes}} or \code{\link{aes_string}}. Only needs to be set
at the layer level if you are overriding the plot defaults.}

\item{data}{A data frame. If specified, overrides the default data frame
defined at the top level of the plot.}

\item{stat}{The statistical transformation to use on the data for this
layer, as a string.}

\item{position}{Postion adjustment, either as a string, or the result of
a call to a position adjustment function.}

\item{na.rm}{If \code{FALSE} (the default), removes missing values with
a warning.  If \code{TRUE} silently removes missing values.}

\item{show_guide}{logical. Should this layer be included in the legends?
\code{NA}, the default, includes if any aesthetics are mapped.
\code{FALSE} never includes, and \code{TRUE} always includes.}

\item{...}{other arguments passed on to \code{\link{layer}}. There are
  three types of arguments you can use here:

  \itemize{
  \item Aesthetics: to set an aesthetic to a fixed value, like
     \code{color = "red"} or \code{size = 3}.
  \item Other arguments to the layer, for example you override the
    default \code{stat} associated with the layer.
  \item Other arguments passed on to the stat.

\description{
This is a variant \code{\link{geom_point}} that counts the number of
observations at each location, then maps the count to point size. It
useful when you have discrete data.

\examples{
ggplot(mpg, aes(cty, hwy)) +
 geom_point()

ggplot(mpg, aes(cty, hwy)) +
 geom_count()

# Best used in conjunction with scale_size_area which ensures that
# counts of zero would be given size 0. Doesn't make much different
# here because the smallest count is already close to 0.
